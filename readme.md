![count all the git commits](https://github.com/ericduran/drupalcores/raw/pystart/img.jpg)


Python script to parse all the git commit, aggregate every users commit count and generate
a flat html page for easy viewing for all the contributes and commit counts.

## Instructions
First you need to clone a copy of the drupal 8 branch into your drupalcores directory

    git clone --branch 8.x http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git
    git clone --branch gh-pages git@github.com:ericduran/drupalcores.git pages

Once you have a git repo of drupal core in the drupal directory then you can run the cores.py script

    ./cores.py
